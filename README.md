The closer T is to 0, the more likely there isn't a significant difference.

If p < alpha = 0.05, you have a statistically significant difference.

We now have the p-value of our test, which is greater than our significance level (0.05), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

  The two-tailed P value equals 0.6072
   This difference is considered to be not statistically significant.

For this we have used suspension coil data collected from 3 lots. 
After calculating the total, and each lot mean, median, variance and SD as shown picture below;

This results shows us that lot 1 and 2 has similar data however lot 3 has higher standard deviation which means the there was a dispertion of data values.

P Value Results
Total with mu=1500

t=-1.8931     p=0.06
   This result is not statistically significant.

Lot1
t=0   p=1  
  This result is not statistically significant.
   
Lot2
P Value Results
t=0.51745  p=0.6072
   
  This result is not statistically significant.

Lot3  
t=-2.0915    p=0.042
 
   This difference is considered to be statistically significant since it is less than 0.05
