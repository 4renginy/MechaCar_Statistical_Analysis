# Module15-MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Below pic shows the p value we have calculated as summary for mpg against  vehicle, length, vehicle weight, spoiler_angel, ground_clearance, AWD. 

p=5.35e-11 shows significant level of effect on fuel efficiency.

For this we have used suspension coil data collected from 3 lots. 
After calculating the total, and each lot mean, median, variance and SD as shown picture below;

This results shows us that lot 1 and 2 has similar data however lot 3 has higher standard deviation which means the there was a 
dispertion of data values.
